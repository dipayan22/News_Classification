# News_Classification
This is a simple web app that can classify news articles into different categories based on their content. The app uses a machine learning model trained on a large corpus of news articles from various sources and topics. The app can handle text input or URL input, and it will display the predicted category and the confidence score for the input.

# How to use the app
To use the app, you can either type or paste some text from a news article into the text box, or enter a valid URL of a news article into the URL box.
